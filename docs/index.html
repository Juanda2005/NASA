        <h2>What is our problem?</h2>
        <p>In the problem to be solved, various aspects are taken into consideration, we note as the problem to be solved: the development of predictions with the raw data from the DSCOVR and the processing of these predictions that allows us to verify; 
            an adaptive neutral network where the planetary K index (Kp) is detected, which indicates the magnitude of the geomagnetic storms detected.</p>

                    <h3>Search for component h</h3>
                    <p>When analyzing the data provided we had to identify and recognize them, we were able to obtain coordinates (vector components) in nanonoteslas and additional data, upon noticing this we carried out an investigation of how these could help us, we discovered that given the coordinates (vector components), We could make the transformation from GSE coordinates to GSM,
                         with the objective of finding the h component (reference to the intensity or strength of the magnetic field). Having the GSM coordinates we perform the calculation of this component. <br>

                          The formula to calculate the H component is as follows: <br> H=F⋅cos(D) <br>

                         Where: <br>
                        
                         H is the horizontal component of the magnetic field. <br>
                         
                         F is the total intensity of the magnetic field. <br>
                         
                         D is the magnetic declination. <br>
                         The total intensity of the magnetic field <br>
                         (F) is measured in nanoteslas (nT) or gammas (γ), and the magnetic declination <br>
                         (D) is measured in degrees. <br>
                         Already having the h component, we took into account in order to determine how many hours to average this, the criterion (initial/basic truth) of: using a validation data set to determine the hours that provide the best predictions based on performance metrics , such as mean square error or precision. Where we analyze the behavior of the data in 3-hour averages. 
                         When carrying out this analysis we found that 3 hours would be our best option taking into consideration our criteria.</p>

                    <h3>Deviation of the H component value of Kp</h3>
                    <p>When wanting to obtain a result that allows us to reach a scale or level, we took into account the planetary K index (Kp), 
                        when analyzing it we managed to find a correlation of this with the standard deviation of the h component, so we carried out 
                        the deviation of this and we obtained the Kp value corresponding to the deviation.
                        given the formula.</p> <br>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Our Objective is the Development of predictions with raw data from the DSCOVR and development of an adaptive neutronal network for the prediction of Kp levels, making use of the planetary K index (Kp), 
            data that indicates the magnitude of geomagnetic storms.</p>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>
            Given all the consequences of geomagnetic storms, the benefits generated by making their predictions include: The protection of electrical infrastructure, Scientific research, 
            Security of communication and navigation networks, Protection of space technology, Protection of satellites. 
            Earth observation and many more, these predictions help take preventive measures and mitigate risks in a variety of areas, from critical infrastructure to space exploration. <br>
            We hope that our solution contributes to the processing of predictions given thanks to the CSCOVR data, giving warning of these storms in time to take appropriate precautions, mitigating the risks or consequences of these on earth.
